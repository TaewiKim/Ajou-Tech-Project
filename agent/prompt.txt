Build an interactive ASCII art drawing tool with sound feedback. The application should:
 
1. Create a canvas where users can draw by clicking and dragging
2. Place different ASCII characters or symbols when the user draws
3. Play corresponding musical notes when each character is placed
4. Include multiple pattern sets with different characters and corresponding note scales
5. Add a pattern switcher button to cycle through different character/sound themes
6. Include a clear button to reset the canvas
7. Support both mouse and touch input for mobile compatibility
 
The application should be creative and fun to use, creating an audio-visual experience where patterns of characters create both visual art and musical patterns. Ensure the musical notes are harmonious when played in sequence.
